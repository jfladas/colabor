# Sprint 1

_Re-Code Re-Think_
As a starting point, we re-coded Anton Bruhin’s MMVII. Gesundheit, Glück und Geld im Neuen Jahr (2006). The original work features abstract compositions and pixel-based textures. Each of us explored different aspects of the piece, transforming them through code.

## [Pixels](https://jfladas.github.io/colabor/sprint1/pixels/)

Explores structured pixel patterns and the visual moiré effect created by overlapping circular inversion and obstruction effects. Inspired by the illusion of depth and interference seen in Bruhin’s original work.
