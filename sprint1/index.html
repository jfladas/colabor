      For our first sprint, we chose to re-code MMVII. Gesundheit, Glück und
      Geld im Neuen Jahr (2006) by Anton Bruhin. We were immediately drawn to
      the visuals of the work, especially its abstract compositions and
      pixelated textures. The piece is eye-catching and creates a strong
      foundation to build on. The fact that it includes several components and
      opportunities to reimagine the work was one of the main reasons why we
      chose it. Each of us could select an aspect of the work and transform it
      into something new through code while experimenting based on personal
      interests and skill levels.</p>
    <p>
      We could not find a lot of information about this specific work in our
      research, so we can't say for sure how exactly Bruhin created it. We
      found that he had created similar pieces using Microsoft Paint or
      Microsoft Word, and we assume this one was made with similar digital
      tools.</p>
    <p>
      What fascinated me most was the visual effect that resembles the
      interference seen when photographing a digital screen. Through research
      I found that this phenomenon is known as the moiré effect and it occurs
      when two similar patterns overlap at slight offsets, creating new, often
      surprising patterns. Bruhin's work captures this sensation within a
      static pixel grid, simulating motion and depth through simple repetition
      or inversion. I started by building a pixel grid, since the work clearly
      relies on pixel-based patterns. My first step was recreating a
      background of black and white horizontal stripes. I then experimented
      with two main techniques: obstruction, which turns areas into vertical
      black and white stripes based on adjacent pixel colors, and inversion,
      which flips pixel colors.</p>
    <p>
      At first, I applied these to rectangles, but since many shapes in
      Bruhin's work appear curved, I extended the approach to circles. This
      was more challenging due to pixel calculations. By combining obstruction
      and inversion, I could create an illusion of depth, making circles
      appear like raised buttons.</p>
    <p>
      Next, I experimented with animation, repetition, and background
      variations. One of the most visually exciting effects came from
      repeatedly inverting slightly offset circles. This layering technique
      created visuals similar to the moiré patterns that initially caught my
      attention.</p>
    <p>
      Finally, I explored interactivity by adding a real-time camera layer. In
      this version, the darker areas of the live feed are dynamically
      obstructed, resulting in a responsive, evolving graphic.
